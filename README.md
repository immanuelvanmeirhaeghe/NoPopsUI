Originally, I created this app to browse Aniwave, Mangafire and other otaku websites. I got fed up with mallicious popups and popunders suddenly appearing on my mobile or portable device while navigating the sites. I could not find a dedicated site app, so the only option was to use my mobile device's build-in web browser.

I did not want to use any 3rd party browser add-ons nor block the site owner's advertisements and non-exposed site functionality, so decided to develop my own customizable site reader / viewer app.

Now I use it on a daily basis and hope you will enjoy it to!
